# Ecommerce (Backend)
This project has the goal to establish the knowledge that I’m getting about Spring boot, Spring security, Docker and Microservices.
The way that I will do this project is by versions, so every version will have some new features and of course new technologies.

The project is about a simple API to an ecommerce where the customers could register and buy products.
